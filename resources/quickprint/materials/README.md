These are material profiles for Cura, created and tested by
[Type A Machines][] for use on the [Series 1 3D printer][].

You can read all about the [materials we offer][] on our website.

# Loading a profile

To load a material profile into Cura:

1. From the `Expert` menu select `Switch to full settings`.
2. From the `File` menu select `Open Profile Settings`.
3. Open the profile you want to use.

This will replace your current print settings, so you may want to save
them first using `File` â†’ `Save Profile Settings`.

If you have questions, contact our [support][] team.
